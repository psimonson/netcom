## Network Commander

This is a simple implementation for a command interpreter that you can use across the network. It is NOT a production software may have bugs, although it's been tested a lot. This is just an example showing how to write a command interpreter for the network.

### Notes

 - There are two example plugins to show how to make plugins. One is a command extension plugin and the other is a module plugin.

 - Modules can be launched with run and you don't need the extension '.dll' or '.so'.

Here is a small break down of how to run commands in this application. There are brackets around the arguments, if the square brackets have nothing inside them. There are no arguments to that command. Below is a list of all argument types.
